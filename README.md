# RailsBlog

### What?
It's a minimal [web API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface#Web_APIs) for managing a fake blog, adding, editing and deleting blog posts. Comments are also supported.

### How?
Under the hood, it's a Ruby on Rails application. The blog posts and their comments are stored in a PostgreSQL database (postgresql is required by Heroku).
Here are the version of the most major components of the app:
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) 2.4.3
- [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) 5.1.4
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) 10
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)

### Where?
The API is currently deployed on Heroku (right [here](https://immense-fjord-39586.herokuapp.com)). Head over to that page to see a detailed description of the API and find out how to use it.
